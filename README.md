This is the public repo of the wvvw.me node.js website if you find a bug please use the issues section to report it.

This is under the ```DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE``` so if you want to use this for your site then go ahead but please don't say this code is yours because that's just a dick thing to do. Though I can't really stop you.
